## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## Developing & testing

After pulling the repository you can prepare the application by installing dependencies and creating a database. Once your `.env` is configured, run migrations to create necessary tables:

```powershell
cd laravel_app
composer install
php artisan migrate
```

A new **healthcare_workers** table now exists and there's a corresponding `HealthcareWorker` model and controller. You can register a worker via the sign‑up form at `/healthcare-register`, then log in at `/login`.

Health‑care users may visit `/healthcare-profile` to view and edit their profile information; the route is protected by the `CheckAccountType` middleware.

For quick testing you can seed a user via Tinker, e.g.: 

```powershell
php artisan tinker --execute "\App\Models\User::create(['fullname'=>'Test Worker','email'=>'worker@example.com','password'=>\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash::make('secret'),'accounttype'=>'healthcare_worker','verified'=>1,'approved'=>1]);"
php artisan tinker --execute "\App\Models\HealthcareWorker::create(['user_id'=>1,'profession'=>'nurse']);"
```

Then run the built-in server:

```powershell
php artisan serve --port=8000
```

and browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login`.
